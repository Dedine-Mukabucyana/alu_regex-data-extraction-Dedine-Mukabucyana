This project shows how to use Regular Expressions (Regex) in Python to find useful information inside plain text.
It works like a tool that scans text and picks out important data — just like how a developer might read API results and pull out key details.

The program can find:

📧 Email addresses

🔗 Website links (URLs)

💳 Credit card numbers

📄 HTML tags (like <div>, <p>, <img>)
💰 Currencies

⚙️ Setup Instructions
    .Python 3.6 or higher

    .Git
